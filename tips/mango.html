            <p>Mangos, delicious in smoothies, luscious in salsa, can be a slimy,
                slippery challenge to cut. The best way to go about it is to start first
                with a ripe, but still firm fruit. If the mango is too ripe, it will be
                a mushy mess, and hard to cut into pieces, though easy enough to scoop
                out for pulp.</p>
           
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p> The mango has a flat-ish oblong pit in the center of it. Your objective
                is to cut along the sides of the pit, separating the flesh from the pit.
                Holding the mango with one hand, stand it on its end, stem side down.
                Standing up the mango up like this you should be able to imagine the
                alignment of the flat, oval pit inside of it. With a sharp knife in your
                other hand, cut from the top of the mango, down one side of the pit.
                Then repeat with the other side. You should end up with three pieces —
                two halves, and a middle section that includes the pit.
                Take a mango half and use a knife to make lengthwise and crosswise cuts
                in it, but try not to cut through the peel.
                At this point you may be able to peel the segments right off of the peel
                with your fingers. Or, you can use a small paring knife to cut away the
                pieces from the peel.
                Take the mango piece with the pit, lay it flat on the cutting board. Use
                a paring knife to cut out the pit and remove the peel.
